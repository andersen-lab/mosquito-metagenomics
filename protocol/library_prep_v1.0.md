# Library Prep for Pooled Mosquito Metatranscriptomics

#### Introduction
The purpose of this protocol is to generate metatranscriptomic libraries from pooled mosquito samples that are suitable for sequencing on an Illumina platform. The recommended starting material is 1 ug of total RNA extracted with the Mag-Bind Viral DNA/RNA kit, but success maybe achieved with lower amounts or though a different kit.

#### Procedure  
1. Clean All surfaces and pipettes thoroughly with RNase AWAY (ThermoFisher) or similar.
2. Prepare a 50 ul DNase reaction by mixing the following:
|   Component   |   1x (ul) |   8 + 10%   |
| ---   |   --- |   --- |   --- |
|   TURBO DNase buffer  |   5   |   44  |
|   TURBO DNase |   1   |   4.4 |
|   RNA |   1-44 ul |   -   |
|   Water   | up to 50 ul | -   |

3. Incubate at 37C for 30 minutes.
    a. During incubation, remove RNAClean XP beads from 4C and allow to warm to room temperature. Throughly mix the RNAClean XP beads before use.
4. Remove tubes from the thermal cycler and add 1.4 volumes of RNAClean XP beads  (70 ul) to each sample, mixing well by pipetting 10 times. 
5. Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes.
6. Apply the tubes to a magnet and remove the supernatant, taking care not to remove the beads. 
7. Washing 3 times with 70% ethanol and then let air dry for <10 minutes following the final wash.
8. Elute in 30 ul molecular grade water.
